# Diminishing Pools for FoundryVTT

This module adds the ability for GMs to add "Diminishing Pools", dice pools that shrink in size depending on the results.  
Pools can be created using the `/addpool` or `/newpool` chat commands.  
The amount and type of dice in a pool are configurable, as well as the "threshold" each die needs to roll above to not get dropped from the pool.  
Pools can also be marked as hidden, in which case they will not be visible to non-GM users.

Currently configured pools can be seen in the tracker application accessible through the `/pools` chat command.
